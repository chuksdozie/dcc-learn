## 🌍 What is DCC Learn?

DCC Learn is a platform that:

- Aggregates top tech learning resources (videos, courses, tutorials)
- Categorizes them by **skill level**, **cost** (free or paid), and **discipline**
- Embeds video content (e.g. from YouTube) directly on the platform
- Encourages community contributions through an open review process
- Keeps users on the platform by **embedding content** rather than redirecting

It’s built for developers, designers, and other tech learners who want a focused, clutter-free learning experience curated by real community members.
